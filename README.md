# [TalkAI — Your chatty, slightly weird AI sidekick](https://talkai-phi.vercel.app) 🤖🎉

Welcome to [TalkAI](https://talkai-phi.vercel.app) — a tiny, opinionated playground for building conversational UIs that feel less robotic and more like your favourite barista who also happens to know a lot about history. It's minimal, remixable, and ready for developers who want to prototype chat experiences quickly.

What it does
- Spins up a developer-first chat playground so you can send prompts and get replies.
- Wires a frontend to an AI backend so messages flow like sweet, caffeinated conversation.
- Includes examples for sending prompts, handling replies, and iterating fast on UX for conversations.

What it's made with (the techy tasty bits)
- JavaScript / TypeScript — glue code & brain surgery
- Node.js — backend server energy
- Frontend: React + Vite (or swap in your fav framework) — snappy UI vibes
- Styling: TailwindCSS or plain CSS — choose your warp and weft
- OpenAI API — the language-model magic engine
- Real-time: WebSockets or HTTP (your call) for interactive feels


Important note about the OpenAI API key
- Heads up! The OpenAI API key currently does not have tokens — meaning requests will fail until the key has available tokens/quota. If you try to generate responses right now, they'll error out. Please top up the account or use a key with available quota before running the app.

License
- MIT. Do cool stuff. Be kind.

Have fun — and may your prompts be ever creative! 🚀
TalkAI — chatty by design, delightful by accident.
